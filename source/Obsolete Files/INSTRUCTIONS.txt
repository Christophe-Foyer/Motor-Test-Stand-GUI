EDIT: you can now use the .exe file, just run that if you are on Windows

INSTRUCTIONS (for running the script on its own):
Use Pip to install dependencies (google "python pip" if you don't know how, or I guess you can email me, christophe.aa.foyer@gmail.com)
Dependencies (if there are any more it should tell you in the error message):
-Python 2.7 (or any 2.x version is likely to work)
-matplotlib
-tkinter
-pySerial
-numpy

run the "control panel.py"

Don't do anything too funky please, robustness is not guarenteed as of yet.
